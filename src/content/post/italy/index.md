There are few moments in life where one has the opportunity to be completely immersed in the present. My time in Paderno del Grappa[^1] gave me the opportunity to reflect on the things in life that once felt so universal. Time seemed to slow down, strangers felt like friends, and community was a vital part of life. I reflect on my time at the piazza[^2], sitting around small metal tables with the new friends I'd made while abroad. Families gathered around the many coffee shops, ordering espressos while enjoying the beautiful weather of Italy in June.
