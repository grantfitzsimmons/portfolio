# Visiting Madrid, Spain

On this trip, I had a three goals:

1.  Host a [CETAF workshop at the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales](https://web.archive.org/web/20251229165128/https://cetaf.org/join-the-advanced-specify-course/)
    
2.  Build a community with European users of Specify software
    
3.  Explore Spanish culture, art, and food
    

Travel began with about 16 hours of transit between my home airport in Kansas City, Missouri and the Madrid airport in Spain.
