On this trip, I had a three goals:

1.  Host a [CETAF workshop at the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales](https://web.archive.org/web/20251229165128/https://cetaf.org/join-the-advanced-specify-course/)
    
2.  Build a community with European users of Specify software
    
3.  Explore Spanish culture, art, and food
    

Travel began with about 16 hours of transit between my home airport in Kansas City, Missouri and the Madrid airport in Spain.

## Specify Workshop

This was, by most measures, the most difficult to prepare for workshop of all. This is because it included four days, 9 hours a day, of course material. We had to have slide decks prepared, practiced demos, and live Q&A sessions covering topics raised by participants that we could often not anticipate. It took about 2 weeks of (mostly) concentrated preparation to put everything together.
