On this trip, I had a three goals:

1.  Host a [CETAF workshop at the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales](https://web.archive.org/web/20251229165128/https://cetaf.org/join-the-advanced-specify-course/)
    
2.  Build a community with European users of Specify software
    
3.  Explore Spanish culture, art, and food
    

Travel began with about 16 hours of transit between my home airport in Kansas City, Missouri and the Madrid airport in Spain.

## Specify Workshop

This was, by most measures, the most difficult to prepare for workshop of all. This is because it included four days, 9 hours a day, of course material. We had to have slide decks prepared, practiced demos, and live Q&A sessions covering topics raised by participants that we could often not anticipate. It took about 2 weeks of (mostly) concentrated preparation to put everything together. [Theresa Miller](https://orcid.org/0009-0002-0186-0216) and I spent quite a bit of time preparing with Michael Bublé or Tom Petty echoing in the background.

# Travel

## Madrid

I spent the first week of the trip in Madrid as this was the center point for our conference. Íñigo Granzow showed our team around and was an absolute joy to work and explore with.

I had my first experience with [Spanish _tapas_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapas), and it was fantastic. Pair good company with wine, beer, or Coke Zero, along with patatas bravas (spicy potatoes with varying levels of heat), calamares fritos, Iberian jamón, pan con tomate, or even navajas (razor clams), and you're sure to have a great time.

I had time to see everything on my list during my visit, and we had a chance to try some incredible restaurants (notably [Taberna Alipio Ramos](https://share.google/51eLalvKsusLhF1Mh), [Ni Subo Ni Bajo](https://share.google/6sz4Ptlbrgfp2VlbN), and my favorite- [Bodega de los Secretos](https://share.google/zgXZ52ypVOVQKOGQD)).

While in Madrid, I had a chance to see:

*   National Museum of Natural Sciences (MNCN, CSIC)
    
    *   This was where I spent most of my daytime hours during the visit, next to the time our team spent together at the hotel.
        
*   Royal Palace of Madrid
    
*   Museo Nacional del Prado
    
*   Plaza Mayor (too many times)
    
*   Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía
    
*   Mercado de San Miguel
    
*   Temple of Debod
    
*   Gran Vía
    
*   Royal Basilica of Saint Francis the Great
    
*   Real Jardín Botánico (with a wonderful tour of the gardens and collections space by Jesús Muñoz)
    
*   Puerta del Sol (and a live show celebrating the history of Spain)
    
*   Retiro Park
    

## Seville

As a child, I lived in the suburbs of Kansas City, so Seville was naturally the first city in Spain I learned about. It is considered the first "sister city" because Kansas City was invited to exhibit at the 1992 World’s Fair in Seville.

A prominent landmark in Kansas City is [The Giralda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giralda_\(Kansas_City\)), which was inspired by developer J. C. Nichols' visit to Seville in the 1920s. He constructed a half-scale replica of the iconic Spanish [Giralda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giralda). During my first visit to the full-scale structure, I was struck by its grandeur. It's no surprise that such an impressive monument, showcasing [Moorish architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moorish_architecture) and steeped in history, would inspire Nichols to create something only half as great. Today, J.C. Nichols is remembered as a key figure in Kansas City's development, but he was also an ardent segregationist. I find it profoundly ironic that a man with his views would construct a monument with so much cultural fusion.

My brother and I had time to visit:

*   Royal Alcázar of Seville
    
*   Setas de Sevilla (plus hours of live entertainment by various incredible [buskers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_performance))
    
*   Catedral de Sevilla
    
*   Parque de María Luisa
    
*   Torre del Oro
    
*   Santa Cruz (an incredible neighborhood)
    
*   Murillo Gardens
    

## Toledo

Our time in Toledo was short, but we had some incredibly unique experiences.

*   The Alcantara Bridge welcomed us into town
    
*   Castillo de San Servando
    
*   Puerta del Sol
    
*   Museum of Santa Cruz
    
*   Plaza de Zocodover
    
*   Toledo train station
    
*   Puerta del Sol
    
*   Puerta de Alfonso VI
    

While many places began to close, we noticed an advertisement posted on the side of a bus stop: a show called '[Circo Encantado](https://elcircoencantado.com)', made for families styled around 'horror' featuring two clowns (Paute and Capitano) arriving at a mansion of Doña Terrorífica, the ringleader of a large assortment of acrobats, jugglers, and other performers.

The show was entirely in Spanish, though fortunately my years of Spanish lessons in the American public school system paid enough dividends that I could follow most of the humor. The same cannot be said for my brother, which gave me the opportunity to translate the bits he missed quietly while we watched the performance.

It was certainly not a [flamenco show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamenco), but it was something really novel and a great look into local performances by very, very talented performers.
