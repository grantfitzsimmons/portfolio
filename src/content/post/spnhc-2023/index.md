I had the opportunity to travel to San Francisco, California, last May to attend my first SPNHC[^1] (often pronounced "spinach") conference. This meeting is exceptionally important for people in the biodiversity field, as it serves as a vital platform for software providers (such as the Specify group), researchers, and institutions to share their latest findings, innovations, and best practices in natural history collections and biodiversity conservation.

Discussions and talks covered topics ranging from specimen management and preservation techniques to the integration of technology in specimen management and research. These meetings often foster collaboration between museum curators, conservationists, and educators. The conference emphasizes the importance of monitoring biodiversity, including presentations on changes and discoveries in our ecosystems, and addresses the urgent need for preservation amid climate change and habitat loss.

For our team, the SPNHC conference provides an invaluable opportunity for networking, allowing us to forge connections with prospective and current Specify users that can lead to future collaborations and data conversions. The workshops and presentations not only inspire new ideas but also equip attendees with practical knowledge that can be applied at their own institutions.

This year, SPNHC held a joint conference with TDWG[^2], known as [SPNHC-TDWG 2024](https://spnhc.org/events/event/spnhc-tdwg-2024/), which took place at the Okinawa Convention Centre in Okinawa, Japan, from September 2 to 6. While it was a grueling flight, it was my first time traveling internationally for a conference and it was a great experience. 



## My Sessions

### Advancing Biological Collections Computing with Specify 7: A Year of Transformational Updates

I gave a talk titled "Advancing Biological Collections Computing with Specify 7: A Year of Transformational Updates", alongside my colleague Theresa Miller. You can read the abstract below:

> The Specify Collections Consortium is enthused to announce that its flagship, open-source, collection management platform, Specify 7, is loaded with impressive new capabilities and a markedly heightened user experience.
>
> Of the hundreds of improvements to Specify 7 released in the last 12 months to the architecture, data operations, and user interface, some changes really stand out. We updated, streamlined, standardized, re-styled, and added capabilities to Specify’s overall design while significantly strengthening the application’s software infrastructure for accessibility and sustainability. We extended existing components and introduced new capabilities beyond the historical Specify 6 benchmark. Specify 7 now boasts a comprehensive, role-based, access and security system that makes creating and provisioning user accounts with fine-grained permissions efficient and scalable. Added to support for single sign-on (SSO, SAML2 and OpenID endpoints), Specify 7 takes collections data security to a higher level.
>
> We enhanced the intelligence of Specify’s data forms behavior and validations to help ensure accurate data entry. We delivered a new and powerful “Meta Menu”, instantly accessible from any data form, with functions for running reports/labels, configuring Carry Forward, auto-numbering, inspecting edit history, ordering results, switching subviews display formats, form definition editing, and URL link sharing. We also improved the functionality of Specify’s tree interface, the WorkBench, the Query Builder, and system configuration tools for editing App Resources.
>
> Additional improvements that make a difference include: better browser page navigation (now each Specify page has a unique URL for easier navigation and reference), user preference synchronization between browser tabs, a new interface for the Darwin Core Archive exporting tool, and for fun, we activated shortcut queries to Collection Object records associated with the taxa displayed in the Taxon Tiles splash screen. We integrated Weblate, a continuous localization service for crowdsourcing the translation of Specify 7, opening the door for operating Specify in dozens of new languages.
>
> Several huge new capabilities in Specify 7 will be released by the SPNHC 2023 meeting, including record deduplication and merging; a configurable statistics panel for defining and customizing statistical summaries of your collection; and Specify Network links to community data providers. We will have integrations of the Extended Specimen concepts and the Fair Digital Object Architecture. All of these technologies and hundreds of user-reported engineering fixes will increase your productivity with collections data computing including the publication of your records to the broader biodiversity data community.
>
> This presentation and accompanying DemoCamp demonstration will highlight many of these empowering, new capabilities and showcase the wealth of capabilities Specify offers for effective collections data curation, management, and integration.

In my presentation, I discussed how the Specify Collections Consortium (SCC) has supported research collections worldwide for over 35 years through its intuitive and customizable software platform. I shared insights from our collaborations with universities and federal agencies, focusing on the development of frameworks to standardize workflows for managing large collections. 

I addressed common hurdles in data preparation, such as unstandardized formats and unparsed taxonomy, and shared strategies to overcome these issues. I  explored the complexities of data sharing between collections, discussing how to balance centralized coordination with individual collection needs. 

***Tip:** When parsing data, use [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org) and [regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions)!*

I emphasized the importance of effective communication and collaboration among staff and volunteers during the transition to a new collections management system. Drawing on our extensive institutional experience, I provided a framework to help organizations navigate the challenges of implementing a collections management system, ultimately aiming to enhance the preservation and accessibility of natural history collections worldwide, with support for geoscience collections coming in the near future.

### Specify Spotlight: Enhancing biodiversity data management

I also had the chance to host a symposium featuring several Specify users who discussed their support for and use of Specify software! This took several months of planning and extensive communication with the participants that would not have been possible without my co-organizer Theresa Miller. These sessions were enormously successful and we filled the room in which the symposium was hosted.
