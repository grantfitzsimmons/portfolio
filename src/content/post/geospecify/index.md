As the point of contact for the Specify team in the GeoSpecify initiative, I’ve had the unique opportunity to engage with a vibrant community of geologists, curators, and researchers from around the world. This experience has been enlightening, challenging, and rewarding, allowing me to play a major role in a project aiming to extend the existing Specify platform to support geoscience collections.

For more detailed insights, check out our publication, **Extending Specify 7 for Geoscience Collections**, which outlines our efforts in depth and can be accessed [here](https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.141673).

## Invitation to Join

In early 2023, Jim Beach, then director of the Specify Collections Consortium, invited me to lead the KU side of the GeoSpecify initiative. I was thrilled about this opportunity! While it felt like a big responsibility, I was eager to dive into such an exciting project.

At that time, I was wrapping up my final year of undergraduate studies in Business Administration. Taking on a project of this scale was definitely a challenge, but I was ready to give it my all. I knew that the success of our work would have a real impact on many individuals and organizations relying on the data model and application we were developing.

As I got more involved, I realized this role was about more than just technical skills. It was about collaboration, communication, and being adaptable. I learned to lean on my strengths and connect with a network of experts and colleagues who shared my passion for advancing geoscience collections. This focus has helped us tackle challenges and keep the project moving forward.

## Project Overview

We had a relatively short timeline to complete the project, with the following key milestones:

- **Duration:** January 2023 - Q1 2025

### Phases of the Project

#### Phase 1 (Complete)

The first phase involved gathering use cases, information models, and best practices. [Ben Norton](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5819-9134), with his extensive experience in Specify and data science, led this effort. He did a fantastic job collecting and evaluating data models from various institutions, helping us navigate the complexities of geological collections. Regular meetings with him and our team provided the clarity and direction we needed to move forward.

I had the privilege of conducting interviews with geological curators and researchers, which provided invaluable insights into the challenges and needs of the community. This foundational work was crucial in shaping our approach since we had never before consulted with so many collections experts in this domain.

#### Phase 2 (In Progress)

Currently, we are focused on designing and engineering the software for GeoSpecify, with an exciting goal of releasing a production-ready version by Q1 2025. This phase has been particularly stimulating, as I’ve been involved in translating the insights from our initial phase into practical software solutions.

## Engaging with Field Experts

Throughout 2023 and early 2024, I connected with a diverse range of scientists and collections personnel from institutions around the globe. These interactions, both virtual and in-person, were incredibly enriching. I learned firsthand how different institutions manage their specimens and data, and their feedback has been instrumental in refining our models.

### Notable Institutions I Engaged With

- Mindat.org
- The University of Kansas
- Denver Museum of Nature and Science
- Museum of Geology at South Dakota School of Mines
- Jackson Museum of Earth History at University of Texas at Austin
- California Academy of Sciences
- Colorado School of Mines
- CSIRO Australia
- Natural History Museum Bern
- Natural History Museum Basel
- Natural History Museum Lausanne
- Smithsonian Institution
- Natural History Museum Geneva
- Scripps Institution of Oceanography
- ...and many others.

We discussed a wide range of topics, including:

- **Unique Identifiers**: The use of unique identifiers such as SESAR and IGSN numbers for registering and ordering specimens was a common theme.

- **Collection Management Practices**: Various institutions explored their management practices, including the importance of structured measurement data, cataloging, and the use of specific software tools like EMu, Specify, and FileMaker Pro.

- **Data Fields and Specifications**: Discussions included the types of data fields important for geology collections, such as dimensions, chemical information, rock types, and collector information.

- **Research and Specimen Handling**: Institutions shared their approaches to researching and handling geological specimens, including cores, minerals, and meteorites.

- **Collaboration and Integration**: We explored potential collaborations on data management, including the use of APIs and integration of systems like Mindat.org with Specify.

- **Digitization and Data Management**: The digitization process and management of various material types within collections were significant points of discussion, along with improving coordination and protocols for data management.

- **Demonstrations and Software Usage**: Some institutions provided demonstrations of their databases and discussed their workflows for managing geological data. This helped us understand the current landscape and identify areas for improvement.

## The GeoSpecify Advisory Committee

To ensure we stay aligned with the needs of our users, we established the GeoSpecify Advisory Committee, comprising 40 experts from over 30 collections. This committee has been a vital resource, providing guidance and feedback throughout our journey.

### **GeoSpecify Advisory Committee Meetings**

- 5 April 2023 (**Introduction**)
- 26 July 2023 (**Unique Identifiers**)
- 28 September 2023 (**Containers**)
- 14 November 2023 (**Geologic Age**)
- 7 February 2024 (**Multiple Object Types**)
- 31 July 2024 (**Catalog Numbering**)
- 2 September 2024 (**Defaults**)
- 3 October 2024 (**Presented Defaults**)

## Insights on the Extended Data Model

One of the highlights of my involvement has been the development of an extended data model that supports enhanced age queries. This feature is crucial for geologists, allowing them to search for specimens based on relative and absolute ages.

## Writing Documentation

I’ve also been involved in writing documentation for the GeoSpecify project, including user guides, technical specifications, and training materials. It’s essential that we make it as easy as possible for users to adopt the new platform, and clear documentation is key to achieving this. Having been the primary author of all user and technical documentation for Specify for over three years, this role felt like a natural extension of my work. Being involved at such a deep level during all phases of the project has made a significant difference.

## Current Status of GeoSpecify

As we enter the final stretch of usability testing for the GeoSpecify initiative, I’m excited about the progress we’ve made as a team and the contributions I've had the opportunity to make individually. I’ve been actively involved in this project since the collaboration began, gathering requirements, working with experts, and making several code additions to enhance the platform's usability.

I compiled default taxonomic trees for minerals, rocks, and meteorites from their respective source authorities, as well as a chronostratigraphy tree in collaboration with the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS). I also outlined the requirements for the major components of this project, met with stakeholders to present our developing platform, and incorporated community feedback into our work. Throughout this process, I worked closely with our internal team in both development and testing to ensure that the platform meets the needs of geoscience collections worldwide.

This collaborative effort is crucial as we refine the platform to effectively serve our users. I’m looking forward to seeing the positive impact of our work as we bring this project to a close. I expect to present many workshops and talks on the GeoSpecify initiative in the coming months for our existing members and prospective users, possibly culiminating in a second visit to our Swiss partners later this year to assist them in their transition to the new platform.
