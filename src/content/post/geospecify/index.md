As the point of contact for the Specify team in the GeoSpecify initiative, I’ve had the unique opportunity to engage with a vibrant community of geologists, curators, and researchers from around the world. This experience has been enlightening, challenging, and rewarding, allowing me to play a major role in a project aiming to extend the existing Specify platform to support geoscience collections.

In early 2023 I was asked by the then director of the Specify Collections Consoritum, Jim Beach, to play a role in the GeoSpecify initiative as a lead for the KU side of the project. I very excited for the opportunity, but equal parts intimidated to play such an important part in this kind of groundbreaking effort. I understood that the success of this project would not only impact my daily obligations but also countless individuals and organizations relying on the data model and application we develop. It felt like a massive weight was on my shoulders, but I could not have been more excited.

At that time, I was still a student navigating my final year of undergraduate studies in Business Administration. The idea of leading such a significant project made me question my abilities. I often wondered if I was truly qualified to contribute meaningfully to an initiative of this scale. The stakes were high, and the responsibility felt immense. I understood that my decisions could influence the project's direction and, ultimately, the success of our entire consortium. Balancing my academic commitments with the demands of this role was daunting, leaving me with a mix of excitement and anxiety. Fortunately, I had a supportive team and mentors who believed in my potential and encouraged me to embrace this opportunity.

However, as I became more intimately involved with the project, I realized that my role was not just about technical expertise but also about collaboration, communication, and adaptability. I had to learn to leverage my strengths and seek support where needed, building a network of experts and colleagues who shared my passion for advancing geoscience collections. This focus has been instrumental in overcoming challenges and driving the project forward, and I have learned many important lessons about the geoscience community and the power of collaboration along the way.

## Project Overview

We had a relatively short timeline to complete the project, with the following key milestones:

**Duration:** January 2023 - Q1 2025

### Phases of the Project

#### Phase 1 (Complete)**

The first phase involved gathering use cases, information models, and best practices. [Ben Norton](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5819-9134), who has extensive experience working with Specify as well as being a data scientist and curation specialist, spearheaded this effort. Ben did an excellent job collecting and evluating data models from various institutions, identifying commonalities and differences, and distilling this information into a series of comprehensive documents for our review. He was generous in his time and expertise, guiding us through the complexities of geological collections and helping us understand the unique challenges faced by the community. Regular meetings with him and our team provided the clarity and direction we needed to move forward.

I had the privilege of conducting interviews with geological curators and researchers, which provided invaluable insights into the challenges and needs of the community. This foundational work was crucial in shaping our approach.

#### Phase 2 (In Progress)

Currently, we are focused on the design and software engineering for GeoSpecify, with an exciting goal of releasing a production-ready version by Q1 2025. This phase has been particularly stimulating, as I’ve been involved in translating the insights from our initial phase into practical software solutions.

## Engaging with Field Experts

Throughout 2023 and early 2024, I connected with a diverse range of scientists and collections personnel from institutions globally. These interactions, both virtual and in-person, were incredibly enriching. I learned firsthand how different institutions manage their specimens and data, and their feedback has been instrumental in refining our models.

### Notable Institutions I Engaged With

- Mindat.org
- The University of Kansas
- Denver Museum of Nature and Science
- Museum of Geology at South Dakota School of Mines
- Jackson Museum of Earth History at University of Texas at Austin
- California Academy of Sciences
- Colorado School of Mines
- CSIRO Australia
- Natural History Museum Bern
- Natural History Museum Basel
- Natural History Museum Lausanne
- Smithsonian Institution
- Natural History Museum Geneva
- Scripps Institution of Oceanography
- ...and many others.

We discussed a wide range of topics, including:

- **Unique Identifiers**: The use of unique identifiers such as SESAR and IGSN numbers for registering and ordering specimens was a common theme.

- **Collection Management Practices**: Various institutions explored their management practices, including the importance of structured measurement data, cataloging, and the use of specific software tools like EMu, Specify, and FileMaker Pro.

- **Data Fields and Specifications**: Discussions included the types of data fields important for geology collections, such as dimensions, chemical information, rock types, and collector information.

- **Research and Specimen Handling**: Institutions shared their approaches to researching and handling geological specimens, including cores, minerals, and meteorites.

- **Collaboration and Integration**: Potential collaborations on data management, including the use of APIs and integration of systems like Mindat.org with Specify.

- **Digitization and Data Management**: The digitization process and management of various material types within collections were significant points of discussion, along with improving coordination and protocols for data management.

- **Demonstrations and Software Usage**: Some institutions provided demonstrations of their databases and discussed their workflows for managing geological data. This helped us understand the current landscape and identify areas for improvement.

## The GeoSpecify Advisory Committee

To ensure we stay aligned with the needs of our users, we established the GeoSpecify Advisory Committee, comprising 40 experts from over 30 collections. This committee has been a vital resource, providing guidance and feedback throughout our journey.

## Insights on the Extended Data Model

One of the highlights of my involvement has been the development of an extended data model that supports enhanced age queries. This feature is crucial for geologists, allowing them to search for specimens based on relative and absolute ages.
