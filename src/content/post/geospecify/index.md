As the point of contact for the Specify team in the GeoSpecify initiative, I’ve had the unique opportunity to engage with a vibrant community of geologists, curators, and researchers from around the world. This experience has been enlightening, challenging, and rewarding, allowing me to play a major role in a project aiming to extend the existing Specify platform to support geoscience collections.

## Project Overview

**Duration:** January 2023 - Q1 2025

### Phases of the Project

#### Phase 1 (Complete)**

The first phase involved gathering use cases, information models, and best practices. [Ben Norton](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5819-9134), who has extensive experience working with Specify as well as being a data scientist and curation specialist, spearheaded this effort.

I had the privilege of conducting interviews with geological curators and researchers, which provided invaluable insights into the challenges and needs of the community. This foundational work was crucial in shaping our approach.

#### Phase 2 (In Progress)

Currently, we are focused on the design and software engineering for GeoSpecify, with an exciting goal of releasing a production-ready version by Q1 2025. This phase has been particularly stimulating, as I’ve been involved in translating the insights from our initial phase into practical software solutions.

## Engaging with Field Experts

Throughout 2023 and early 2024, I connected with a diverse range of scientists and collections personnel from institutions globally. These interactions, both virtual and in-person, were incredibly enriching. I learned firsthand how different institutions manage their specimens and data, and their feedback has been instrumental in refining our models.

### Notable Institutions I Engaged With

- Mindat.org
- The University of Kansas
- Denver Museum of Nature and Science
- South Dakota School of Mines
- University of Texas at Austin
- California Academy of Sciences
- Natural History Museum Bern
- Smithsonian Institution
- ...and many others.

These meetings not only broadened my understanding of geological collections but also fostered a sense of community among professionals dedicated to advancing this field.

## The GeoSpecify Advisory Committee

To ensure we stay aligned with the needs of our users, we established the GeoSpecify Advisory Committee, comprising 40 experts from over 30 collections. This committee has been a vital resource, providing guidance and feedback throughout our journey.

### Key Topics Discussed

- **Introduction to GeoSpecify**
- **Unique Identifiers**
- **Geologic Age**
- **Using GeoSpecify**

These discussions have been enlightening, offering diverse perspectives that have shaped our project's direction.

## Insights on the Extended Data Model

One of the highlights of my involvement has been the development of an extended data model that supports enhanced age queries. This feature is crucial for geologists, allowing them to search for specimens based on relative and absolute ages. 

### Why Extended Age Queries Matter

The ability to query geological time periods using chronostrat names or numbers across various contexts significantly enhances usability. I’ve seen how this functionality can streamline searches and enrich the data available for geological research, making it easier for researchers to find relevant specimens.

In conclusion, my experience with the GeoSpecify initiative has been transformative. I’ve gained a deeper appreciation for the complexities of managing geological collections and the importance of collaboration in advancing our understanding of the geosciences. As we move towards our production release, I am excited about the impact this project will have on the community and look forward to continuing this journey.
